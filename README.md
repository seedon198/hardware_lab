## 1. ****KeyGrabber****

![Untitled](res/Untitled%2011.png)

These are physical hardware keyloggers that are completely transparent from computer operation, and no software or drivers are required. International keyboard layouts are also supported.

See the comparison chart as some versions have a clock/battery for times-stamping keystrokes. Some have a module for sending keystrokes via wireless so you don’t need full physical access again and can obtain keystrokes immediately via TCP direct stream or have keystrokes sent to you via email.

## 2. ****USB Ninja Cable****

![Untitled](res/Untitled%2012.png)

USB Ninja is an information security and penetration testing tool that looks and functions just like a regular USB cable (both power and data) until a wireless remote control triggers it to deliver your choice of attack payload to the host machine. In essence, USB Ninja is the next step in the evolution of BadUSB, embedding the attack in the USB cable itself.

Emulating keyboard and mouse actions, payloads can be completely customized and can be highly targeted. Undetectable by firewalls, AV software (**depending on payload of course**) or visual inspection, the USB Ninja is an ideal tool for penetration testers, police and government.

Includes: 1 cable type of choice and 1 trigger/programming ring.

****$75.00****
